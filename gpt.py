You should act in all of the following three roles, one by one, and think aloud in each of them (provide reasonings):
==========
Roles & Instructions:
==========

(1) Teacher Role
  - Act as a Grade 3â€“5 teacher.
  - Propose a question that is suitable for a grade 3-5 student, focusing on the morphological concept 
    (prefix, suffix, root, etc.) relevant to question_type={question_type}.
  - Provide your chain-of-thought on how the question was formed (provide reasoning, or think aloud), 
    ensuring it's neither too trivial nor too advanced for grades 3â€“5.
  - Then pass along your question and partial choices to the next role.

(2) Student Role
  - Act as a Grade 3â€“5 student.
  - Read what the Teacher proposed. 
  - Comment if the question is confusing, or if any distractor is obviously incorrect.
  - Provide your chain-of-thought as a student (provide reasoning, or think aloud).
  - Then pass along your outputs to the next role.

(3) Technometrician Role
  - Act as a test-design specialist focusing on morphological objectives (prefix, suffix, root, etc.) 
    and checking alignment with word_difficulty={word_difficulty} & task_difficulty={task_difficulty}.
  - Evaluate the question from both Teacher and Student roles:
    - Are we accurately testing the morphological skill for question_type={question_type}?
    - Are the difficulty levels appropriate?
  - Provide final refinements if needed. Be strict if you can make the question or the distractors more aligned with what is asked.
  - Then present the finalized question in a parseable format, exactly as follows:

      Final Question: [refined question text here]
      A) [choice A]
      B) [choice B]
      C) [choice C]
      Correct Answer: [the correct choice]

# 10. A more comprehensive question parser

import re

def parse_question_output(text):
    """
    A comprehensive parser for all the prompting strategies we discussed:
      - zero_shot
      - few_shot
      - chain_of_thought
      - chain_of_thought_plus_sequential
      - chain_of_thought_plus_sequential_rl
      - chain_of_thought_plus_role_chain

    This function carefully extracts:
      - teacher_reasoning, student_reasoning, psychometrician_reasoning
      - chain_of_thought
      - up to 3 steps (step_1, step_2, step_3)
      - question
      - choice_a, choice_b, choice_c
      - correct_answer

    Key Logic / Fallbacks:
      1) We match teacher/student/psychometrician with lines like:
         'Teacher:', '(1) Teacher Role:', 'Student:', 'Psychometrician:', 'Technometrician:', etc.
      2) Chain-of-thought can appear as '--- Chain of Thought ---', 'Chain-of-Thought:', etc.
      3) Steps appear as 'Step 1:', 'Step 1 (Pick Words):', etc., up to Step 3.
      4) Final question is searched in this order:
           - 'Final Question:', 'Updated Question:', 'Final MCQ:', 'My Final Question is:'
           - fallback: 'Question:'
           - if that fails, we look for a line ending with '?'
      5) Choices are labeled 'A)', 'A.', 'A:', 'B)', 'C)', etc. We use a multiline regex to capture
         until we see the next choice label, 'Correct Answer:', or the end of the text (\\Z).
      6) Correct Answer is first looked for with lines like 'Correct Answer:', 'Answer:', or
         'The correct answer is:'. If not found, we see if one of the choices ends with '(Correct answer)'
         (case-insensitive). If so, we remove that parenthetical from the choice and set that as correct_answer.

    It returns a dictionary with these keys:
      {
        'question': str or None,
        'choice_a': str or None,
        'choice_b': str or None,
        'choice_c': str or None,
